/**
 DUXBetaSwiftBindings - This is an extension that allows the developer to bind the the SDK keys observe changes. It allows writting widgets
 and models in Swift. These are the same functionality as the binding macros written in Objective-C (see
 NSObject+DUXBetaRKVOExtension.h) with one small change.
 When using bindRKVOModel to bind paths, all paths are put into a comma separated list inside a string. This list will
 then be decomposed in the binding extension. This is due to the inability to create a vardic list with multiple KeyPath elements.
 
 In general, where the Objective-C macros do inline replacement of property names, those property names need to be put into
 strings to pass as arguments in Swift.
 
 Any property to be observed or modified in Swift needs to be marked as dynamic.
 Also, any property to be observed from Swift which may be nil, MUST have a strong/weak designation if it is in Objective-C code
 to allow for proper treatment as an optional if needed.
